# residential_smart_energy_meter
A project I (along with 3 other team mates) undertook in a typical "48 hours innovation challenge" at Innothon at India Smart Grid Week (ISGW) which took place in NSIT, 2017. The LED on a conventional electronic meter blinks at a specific rate. Arduino takes input, calculates frequency, and predicts energy consumption.
